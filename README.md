#### Abstract
The research focuses on analyzing and modeling credit card transaction data to detect fraud. It includes data pre - processing, visualization, and model training using machine learning algorithms. Future work involves model optimization.

#### Rationale
Credit card fraud causes significant economic losses. Accurate fraud detection is crucial for financial security.

#### Research Question
How to build an effective fraud detection model using credit card transaction data?

#### Data Sources
fraudTrain.csv and fraudTest.csv from the Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset.

#### Methodology
Data Pre - processing: Used pandas for data reading, merging, date - time handling, and encoding.
Visualization: Employed matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing data distribution and correlations.
Model Training: Trained logistic regression and SVM models with sklearn.

#### Results
The performance of logistic regression and SVM models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 - score, but specific results were not detailed.

#### Next steps
Try more machine learning models like KNN, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
Conduct more in - depth feature engineering.
Tune model hyperparameters.

#### Conclusion
Result Evaluation: A preliminary fraud detection model was built, but performance needs improvement.
Suggestions: Optimize the model through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
Cautions: Consider data real - time and model scalability in practical applications.
